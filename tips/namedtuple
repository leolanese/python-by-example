# Using immutable namedtuple is way shorter than defining a class manually:
from collections import namedtuple
Car = namedtuple('car', 'color mileage')

# Our new "Car" class works as expected:
my_car = Car('Misano Red Pearlescent', 14000)

# print the component of the Class
print(my_car.color, my_car.mileage) # Misano Red Pearlescent, 14000
print(my_car) # car(color='Misano Red Pearlescent', mileage=14000)

# Like tuples, namedtuples are immutable:
# my_car.color = 'blue' # !Exception has occurred: exceptions.AttributeError
