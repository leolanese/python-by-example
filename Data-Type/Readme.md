# Python Data-Types

> Keep in mind that Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type explicitly

> There are four collection data types in Python :

- List: is a collection which is ordered and changeable(modifiable). Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple: is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable or unmodifiable(immutable). Allows duplicate members.
- Set: is a collection which is unordered, un-indexed and unmodifiable, but we can add new items to the set. Duplicate members are not allowed.
- Dictionary: is a collection which is unordered, changeable(modifiable) and indexed. No duplicate members.


| Data Type         | Description                                   | Example                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| int               | Integer numbers                               | `42`, `-10`, `0`           |
| float             | Floating-point numbers                        | `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`    |
| str               | String (text)                                 | `'Hello'`, `"Python"`      |
| bool              | Boolean (True or False)                       | `True`, `False`            |
| list              | Ordered collection, mutable sequence of elements         | `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b']`  |
| tuple             | Ordered collection , immutable sequence of elements       | `(1, 2, 3)`, `('a', 'b')`  |
| set               | Unordered collection of unique elements       | `{1, 2, 3}`, `{'a', 'b'}`  |
| dict              | Key-value collection  pairs mapping                       | `{'name': 'John', 'age': 25}` |
| complex           | Complex numbers                               | `1 + 2j`, `3 - 4j`         |
| NoneType          | Represents the absence of a value (null)      | `None`                     |
