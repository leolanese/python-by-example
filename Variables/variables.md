# Creating Variables

> Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

> Python variables are case-sensitive

## Python is `dynamically typed` but `strongly typed`

```js
x = 5  # x is an integer
x = "Hello"  # x is now a string

print(x); # Hello
print(type(x)); # <class 'str'>
```

```
x, y, z = "Leo", "Tom", "Sam"
print(x, y, z); # Leo, Tom, Sam
```
