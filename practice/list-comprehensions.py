# Python's list comprehensions

vals = [expression 
        for value in collection 
        if condition]

# This is equivalent to:
vals = []
for value in collection:
    if condition:
        vals.append(expression)

# Example:
even_squares = [x * x for x in range(10) if not x % 2
even_squares # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
